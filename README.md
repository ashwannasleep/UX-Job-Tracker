# Ashpire

A career development platform designed to help users organize job searches, track applications, and manage career-related tasks in one place.

Ashpire focuses on clarity, structure, and reducing the mental overhead of job searching through a clean UX and thoughtful data modeling.

## Overview

Ashpire was built to address a common problem: job applications are scattered across spreadsheets, notes, emails, and different platforms.

This project explores how a centralized, UX-driven system can make career planning more intentional and less overwhelming.

## Key Features

- Job application tracking with status management
- Centralized view of applied, interviewing, and rejected roles
- Structured input for company, role, and notes
- User authentication and persistent data storage
- Clean, minimal interface focused on usability

## UX & Product Focus

Ashpire emphasizes real-world usage patterns rather than feature overload:

- Clear empty states for first-time users
- Explicit status transitions for applications
- Predictable navigation and data updates
- Interfaces designed to reduce cognitive load during stressful workflows

The goal is to support consistency and momentum during long job searches.
